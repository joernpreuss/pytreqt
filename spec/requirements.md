# pytreqt Requirements Specification

## Functional Requirements (FR)

### FR-1: Requirements Extraction
**FR-1.1**: The system shall extract requirement IDs from test docstrings using the pattern `Requires: REQ-ID`
**FR-1.2**: The system shall support multiple requirement IDs per test (comma-separated)
**FR-1.3**: The system shall ignore malformed requirement references and report them as warnings

### FR-2: Requirements Validation
**FR-2.1**: The system shall validate that all referenced requirement IDs exist in the REQUIREMENTS.md file
**FR-2.2**: The system shall report invalid requirement references with test location
**FR-2.3**: The system shall support requirement ID formats: FR-X.Y, BR-X.Y, NFR-X.Y

### FR-3: Coverage Reporting
**FR-3.1**: The system shall generate coverage reports showing which requirements are tested
**FR-3.2**: The system shall display test results with colorized status indicators (✓, ✗, ⊝)
**FR-3.3**: The system shall show untested requirements in coverage reports
**FR-3.4**: The system shall generate TEST_COVERAGE.md with traceability matrix

### FR-4: Test Execution Integration
**FR-4.1**: The system shall integrate with pytest as a plugin
**FR-4.2**: The system shall collect requirements during test discovery phase
**FR-4.3**: The system shall work with parallel test execution (pytest-xdist)
**FR-4.4**: The system shall capture test results and map to requirements

### FR-5: CLI Interface
**FR-5.1**: The system shall provide a `show` command to display coverage from last run
**FR-5.2**: The system shall provide a `coverage` command to generate detailed reports
**FR-5.3**: The system shall provide a `changes` command to detect affected tests
**FR-5.4**: The system shall provide a `stats` command to show coverage statistics

### FR-6: Data Persistence
**FR-6.1**: The system shall cache coverage data in `.pytest_cache/requirements_coverage.json`
**FR-6.2**: The system shall include execution metadata (timestamp, command, environment)
**FR-6.3**: The system shall detect database type from environment variables
**FR-6.4**: The system shall preserve git state information in coverage data

## Business Requirements (BR)

### BR-1: Quality Assurance
**BR-1.1**: The system shall prevent requirement typos from going undetected
**BR-1.2**: The system shall ensure all business requirements have corresponding tests
**BR-1.3**: The system shall provide traceability between requirements and tests

### BR-2: Development Efficiency
**BR-2.1**: The system shall integrate seamlessly with existing pytest workflows
**BR-2.2**: The system shall provide immediate feedback during test execution
**BR-2.3**: The system shall support both CI/CD and local development environments

### BR-3: Maintainability
**BR-3.1**: The system shall be self-contained with minimal external dependencies
**BR-3.2**: The system shall support different project structures and requirements formats
**BR-3.3**: The system shall provide clear error messages for configuration issues

### BR-4: Extensibility
**BR-4.1**: The system shall support custom requirement ID patterns via configuration
**BR-4.2**: The system shall allow custom output formats for reports
**BR-4.3**: The system shall enable integration with external documentation systems
